# Happy Garden
<p align="center"><i>This project was adapted from the book <b><a href="https://www.dk.com/us/book/9781465473615-coding-games-in-python/">Coding Games in Python</a></b></i></p>

When this game starts, a cow with a watering can appears in the garden, but there is only one flower. Every few seconds another flower appears or an existing flower begins to wilt. Use the arrow keys to move the cow to the wilted flowers and press the space bar to water them. If any flower remains wilted for more than ten seconds, the game ends. But if the garden is happy for more than 15 seconds, one of the flowers mutates into a fangflower and tries to zap the cow.
